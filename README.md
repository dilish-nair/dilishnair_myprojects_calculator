Press any number then root button or spacebar on keyboard to find the square root of that number.
Press 2^7 the equalto button or Enter button on keyboard to find the result of 2 to the power of 7.
Press any number then "= symbol" or "enter button on key board" then M+ button on calculator or capital M on key board to add this number to the memmory
Similarly use = symbol on calculator or enter button on keyboard before using M- button or small m on keyboard to subtract the display figure from the memmory.
